Welcome to Nullify, the best i-Ready hack!<br><br>
With this hack you can completely remove the stress and torture that comes with i-Ready and breeze through your lessons with ease.</p>

<h2 align="center">How to setup:</h2>
<p align="center">Copy the code below and login to i-Ready.<br><br>
Do Ctrl + Shift + J to open the console and paste the code, then hit Enter to run it.<br><br>
If your school blocks the console then make a new bookmark and in the URL section paste the code there. Click the bookmark anytime to run the code.</p>
